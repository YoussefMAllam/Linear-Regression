This project aims to implement a linear regression model from scratch without relying on any external libraries (with the exception of plotting purposes). The implementation will include desigining a \textit{Matrix} class which will perform all matrix operations needed for linear regression.
A sample of random input data as well as output data based on a pre-determined function with noise added to simulate real world data. The normal equation will be used to compute an approximate value for linear coeffecients which will then be used to approximate the output value for other inputs. Finally, The Mean Squared Error will be used to determine the accuracy of the model.
