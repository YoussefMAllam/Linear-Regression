We now have the ability to use linear Regression to predict future values of any function given that we have enough sample data.
However linear regression does have some drawbacks the most major of which is that it assumes linearity when our original function could be a nonlinear function. This issue is addressed through Polynomial Regression as discussed in the previous section. However it still remains an issue to find the best function to fit this curve to and to what degree the polynomial should be.
Furthermore if you are dealing with real data there could be outliers which is why the data should be filtered to remove any anamoly before applying regression.
Despite all that linear regression is used in various industries and has various applications such as market analysis and sport analysis.
